brief: "Uses random forests ensemble method for analysis"
# This is YAML's block scaler with block-chomping set to keep final newlines, and an indent indicator (|+2) or
# 2.  This means to keep the newline formatting, keep initial indents after the first two spaces, and keep
# the final newlines.  This string gets present exactly as is in model listings.

      This model uses random forest models to identify the faulted cavity and fault type of a C100 event.

      This model is based on work done by Chris Tennant, Tom Powers, etc. and represents the initial model used to
      identify which cavity and fault type is associated with a C100 fault event.  Any individual cavity can be
      identified as the offending cavity.  Any collection of multiple cavities faulting at the same time are given the
      generic label of 'multiple'.  The following fault types may be identified by the model: E_Quench, Microphonics,
      Quench, 'Single Cav Turn off, and Multi-cav Turn Off.

      Additional documentation is available in the package docs folder.
