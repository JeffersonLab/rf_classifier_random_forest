<h1>rf_classifier Random Forest Model Release Notes</h1>
<h2>March 20, 2020 v1.2</h2>
<p>Main change was to implemented new models that exclusively use autoregression to reduce feature extraction time.  Other updates include:
<ul>
    <li>New models trained on considerably more data - ~2000 examples from Spring 2019 - Winter 2020</li>
    <li>0L04 excluded from training and prediction based on guidance from Tom Powers</li>
    <li>Removal of tsfresh as a dependency</li>
    <li>statsmodel package is locked to v0.9 <a href="https://jira.acc.jlab.org/browse/RFFC-13">RFFC-13</a></li>
    <li>Fixed bug in setup-certified.bash compact <a href="https://jira.ac.jlab.org/browse/RFFC-11">RFFC-11</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>January 9, 2020 v1.1</h2>
<p>Various updates made to support retrained models using improved training process.
<ul>
    <li>Models saved in a non-pickly format. Hopefully this will help with architecture (32 vs 64 bit) issues</li>
    <li>Features extracted by tsfresh are now standardized (t-scores based on training data population).</li>
    <li>Documentation updated to include to new jupiter notebook, pip list output, and test set</li>
    <li>Updated requirements.txt file</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Updated methods from analyze() on down to allow caller to specify which MYA deployment to use. Needed for testing.</p>
<p>Updated certified install instructions (in README.MD) to properly handle virtual environment absolute path
    problems.</p>
<p>Root directory includes updated requirements.txt and requirements-certified.txt files which only specify directly
    imported packages. New requirements-dev.txt file captures full environment at development time.</p>
<p>Fixed issue where supplying no event directory generated an exception. Now it prints an error/usage message.</p>
<p>requirements.txt only specifies modules imported by app and not everything exported by pip freeze.</p>
<p>requirements-certified removed since requirements.txt is now identical.</p>
<h2>October 17, 2019 v1.0</h2>
<p>Initial Release</p>
