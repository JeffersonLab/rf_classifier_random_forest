    <li>Documentation updated to include to new jupiter notebook, pip list output, and test set info</li>
    <li>New requirements.txt file only specifies modules imported by app and not everything exported by pip freeze</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Updated methods from analyze() on down to allow caller to specify which MYA deployment to use. Needed for testing</p>
<p>Updated certified install instructions (in README.MD) to update the VIRTUAL_ENV variable after copying to certified
    location</p>
<p>Root directory includes updates requirements.txt, and requirements-certified.txt files which only specify directly
    imported packages. New requirements-dev.txt file captures full environment at development time.</p>
